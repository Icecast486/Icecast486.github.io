                    - The website was an assignment my university assigned to me, on top of the fact that I've never 
                    used HTML or CSS at all, and I wanted to find a new technology to learn. This was a great
                    learning experience for me as I only used www.w3schools.com and google to learn both HTML and CSS. 
                    This was a great way for me to get out of my comfort zone.
                </span>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <span>
                    - Like I said, this was a good way for me to get out of my comfort zone. As a result, I was able
                    to create a portfolio to show off my skills and my projects I've done. Although, CSS can be a 
                    HUGE pain to use first starting out. I suprisingly found the learning process fun.

                    - This trainer (or cheat) is a way for me to practice my reverse engeneering skills. I love to
                    play video games and recently, I've thought about what actaully goes on under the hood when I 
                    play video games. I read some articlles about how to use Cheat Engine's memory scanner, debugger, 
                    and code injector. This was my first glimpse into game hacking.
                </span>
                <span>
                    - As I work on this project and continue to use the tools, I learn more how developers structure their
                    programs and use programming practices I've learn in class such as, object oriented programming.
                </span>
                <span>
                    - Although, this project is VERY time consuming and VERY tedious (extremely) I love doing it as I'm 
                    always leaning new technologies and finding ways to exploit the game!
                </span>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <span>
                    - Overall, this project is great practice for reverse engeneering, finding bugs/exploits,
                    using debuggers, memory scanners, and disassemblers/decompilers. Sure it can be very hard 
                    and tedious, but I've learned not to get discourraged because of how rewarding it is.
